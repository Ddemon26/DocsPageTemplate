### Example of a Good Question

```
Title: "Error 401 when calling /api/resources with valid API key"

I'm getting a 401 Unauthorized error when trying to fetch resources, 
even though my API key should be valid.

Environment:
- Your Project Name version: 1.2.3
- Node.js version: 16.14.0
- Operating system: macOS 12.3

Code:
```javascript
const client = new Your Project Name({
    apiKey: process.env.API_KEY // This is set correctly
});

const resources = await client.resources.list(); // Fails here
```

Error message:
```
Error: 401 Unauthorized - Invalid API key
```

What I've tried:
- Verified the API key is correct in the dashboard
- Checked that environment variable is loaded
- Tested with curl and got the same error

Any ideas what might be wrong?
```
